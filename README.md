# SpotFinder
Spot Finder is an app that lets you find local popular places around you. It features specific informations such as name, address, type of business as well as a gallery of images.

## Technologies
The UI was built using the LBTAtools for a more simplistic approach. The informations were fetched using the Google Places API. I used Dispatch Group to make Asynchronous calls to fetch the images.

## Usage
The app simply loads up custom annotations when you run it. To view more information, you need to press on an annotation. A Google API key is needed to be able to access those informations.
